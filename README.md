# Web-Development

I'm Arbaaz Patwari, and this is my web development repository. I will use this space as a backup for my website data probably. You can use this code to help in your learning of programming and web development if you want. Thanks for stopping by, and have a nice day.

My first website is just testing out various HTML elements and teaches me how they look and work on a web page. I also externally linked in a JavaScript and CSS with script and link tags, respectively, to manage the presentation and functions on the web page.
