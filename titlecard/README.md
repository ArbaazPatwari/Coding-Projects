Hey guys, here are the files and code I used to make a cool gaming wiki website as a web development project. I renamed some stuff and removed an image but it had finished development in Jan 2022. It has 4 interlinked pages, demonstrating various features and elements with a consistent and nice dark blue and grey colour scheme. It is inspired by websites like Fandom, Wikipedia, YouTube, and I have used code and guidance from several sources - most importantly Kevin Powell and W3Schools. Many thanks and respect to them and other resources I have used. I used images found with Google Images, and used Google Icons and Fonts (like the eject icon, and Roboto Mono font).
