Hey guys, here is the pc build for my game called Zone of Malice - which I made as an Application Programming project. Version 1 of this game had finished development in May 2022 - taking me over 13 days. It has a player, NPCs, various enemies, weapon upgrades, different skins, and several rooms to explore. The game sticks to a purple and red colour scheme. I have used code and assets from Epitome and Robert to develop the game, and have used my own custom font called New Technical.
