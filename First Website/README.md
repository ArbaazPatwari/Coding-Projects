# Arbaaz's Definitions Website 
### Language: HTML, CSS, JS

Hey guys, here are the files and code I have used to make this test website. My first website is just testing out various HTML elements and teaches me how they look and work on a web page. I also externally linked in a JavaScript and CSS with script and link tags, respectively, to manage the presentation and functions on the web page. I created this website in October and worked on it for the duration of a week or two.
