# Arbaaz's Definitions Website HTML 

Hey guys, here are the files and code I have used to make this test website. My first website is just testing out various HTML elements and teaches me how they look and work on a web page. I also externally linked in a JavaScript and CSS with script and link tags, respectively, to manage the presentation and functions on the web page. By the way when showing stuff on a web site, all the files and images you want to link on your main website must be in the same folder/directory!
