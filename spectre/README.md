### Language: HTML, CSS, JS
### Code editor: VS Code

Hey guys, this is my personal web development project called spectre. It is an evolution of my old website titlecard, and is a personal blog/ showcase website for my videos and code. It has several improvements like enhanced CSS decorations, some internal navigation, and is even hosted online with GitHub Pages which I find really cool (The service can host your website files for free online if stored in a GitHub repository and configured correctly). The most important accomplishment though is the completion of the game wikis (progress: 25/30). I started researching and development in late June 2022 and am still adding articles and onto it. It currently has 4 main pages: About, Reviews, Projects, Notes; it has 30 subpages (at the moment) excluding 3 boilerplates. There are a lot of images which I didn't compress so you may expect high bandwidth usage and moderate load times. I took much inspiration from a handful of developers who I will include in the credits.
